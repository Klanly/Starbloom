For this VFX pack there is NO SETUP REQUIRED. Simply find the prefab you want and drag it into your scene, it's as easy as that! The prefabs you're looking for will be in the "RainVFX-BryceMacDonald" folder under "Assets-JustRainVFXpack". There are many different variations on each unique VFX which will be covered now:

•MIST: Foggy/thin misting of rain slowly falling like a waterfall. Contains light/medium/heavy variants, which simply increase how thick/intense the mist is.

•SPRINKLE: Very sparse and slow rain fall, contains calm/windy/stormy variants which all contain very little rainfall but changes the intensity in which the drops are blown by the wind (windy being middle-ground and stormy being more intense).

•RAINFALL: A normal amount of rain pouring down at a normal speed; a traditional rain particle effect. Contains calm/windy/stormy as well, which changes the intensity in which the rain falls. Stormy also contains an extra layer of fog added to the rainfall.

•DOWNPOUR: Heavier rainfall, what most would consider a "downpour". Also contains calm/windy/stormy which effects the same parameters as they do in Sprinkle and Rainfall.

•RAINFOREST: Extremely heavy rain with a ton of added fog for very low visibility. Contains straight & slanted variants, which depict the direction in which the rain falls. Slanted contains slightly more fog as well as it's more storm-like in nature.

•EVAPORATION: A light, splotchy fog that very slowly churns in on itself and rises in the sky as it dissipates. Contains light/medium/heavy variants which have differences in thickness and amount of emissions.

•AFTERMATH: A low-to-ground, heavy fog that slowly spreads outward and shifts around forebodingly. Similar to Evaporation but more "solid" fog and less "splotchy". Good to put on the ground under one of the other rain VFX or to use as an "aftermath" fogginess of a rainstorm. Also contains light/medium/heavy for intensity variations.


*|It's important to keep in mind how taxing some of the more intense VFX can be on your game engine because of the large quantity of particles (which is un-preventable if you want a realistic rainstorm). However, the sub emitters (the splashes on the ground) are optimized to be only 2 particles per raindrop, and if any VFX seems to be too intensive on Unity you can simply reduce some of the Emission rates if need be

The demo scene is under Assets-JustRainVFXpack > "Scenes", though the project probably opened on this scene already. It simple contains a few modified prefabs from the selection you receive with this VFX pack to show some possible uses and to give a nice initial visual demo of what you've purchased. Check out the 'Game' view (CAM_GroundLevel) for a nice angle on the set-up demo prefabs!

General knowledge of the Shuriken Particle System is helpful in using these VFX, but not necessary. The one thing you will need to know how to do is change the size/shape of the VFX. To do so: 

•After placing a VFX in-editor, click the little arrow for a dropdown of the sub emitter VFXs under each prefab (some don't have a dropdown)
•It's best to select all of these if you're using a version of Unity that allows you to do so, and then go to the second tab under the inspector: "Shape"
•From here the "Shape" drop-down menu has different options to change shape (if you would like to rotate the shape, simply rotate the prefab)
•All of these VFX will almost always use the "Box" shape, which is currently what they're all on
•Feel free to change the numbers in the "Shape X", "Shape Y", and "Shape Z" values below the dropdown menu
•These values will change the dimensions of the shape to fit the desired location in your scene

Ending Tips:
•It's best to scale VFX in the above-mentioned manner, as simply scaling the prefabs themselves will break the behavior of the VFX in most cases
•You'll need to make sure you're grabbing ALL of the VFX in each prefab when trying to change size or shape, as ones that have added fog like 'windy' and 'stormy' variants will need the fog VFX to be resized as well (following above with the dropdown menus will achieve this)
•You'll have to edit the Emission dropdown as well after resizing to get the desired density, this is mostly just preference and it's up to the user to just take a shot in the dark and see what they like best
